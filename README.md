## Objective

### Recreated the Nixon.com product page workflow using ReactJS, MongoDB, Express, Node, and AWS. I was responsible for the product which included dynamically rendering each watch from its serial #, providing a zoom functionality for each image of the watch for users to closely inspect details, and change to alternative colors and unique serials with the click of their image.
